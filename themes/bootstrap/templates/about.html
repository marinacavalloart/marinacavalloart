            Hi! I am Marina Cavallo, a modern artist, residing in Eagle, Idaho.
          </p>
          <p>
            I create mirror paintings that are signature, one-of-a-kind pieces of art that can change your interior design from ordinary to extraordinary. They are the 3D paintings you want to touch and have a closer look at.
          </p>
          <p>
            This type of art requires some specific skills, like cutting out mirror pieces of different shapes by hand; you can have a glimpse of the process in my videos. I also use texture, crushed crystals, gold leaf, epoxy resin, and other materials. In combination with mirrors, they add that wow-effect to my paintings that many people experince.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mirror paintings are my passion! But I also have many other interests and hobbies, e.g. ballroom dancing, hiking, traveling, writing poems, etc. I practice a healthy and active lifestyle, and feel a strong connection with nature which is my main source of inspiration…
          </p>

                My husband and I absolutely LOVE Marina’s work! The care, expertise, the creativity and personal touch Marina puts into her art pieces is so special. She spends countless hours on each of her projects focusing on design, colors, and textures which she delivers with perfection in her three dimensional art work. Each one of her paintings is extremely unique! We had never even heard of mirror paintings until Marina showed us her work. I cannot speak more highly of the depth and the journey each piece takes you on. Our living room has completed changed its tone and atmosphere with the beautiful Magnolias she brought to life for us.
