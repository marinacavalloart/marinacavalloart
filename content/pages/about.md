Title: About

Hi! I am Marina Cavallo, a modern artist, residing in Eagle, Idaho.

I create mirror paintings that are signature, one-of-a-kind pieces of art that can change your interior design from ordinary to extraordinary. They are the 3D paintings you want to touch and have a closer look at.

This type of art requires some specific skills, like cutting out mirror pieces of different shapes by hand; you can have a glimpse of the process in my videos. I also use texture, crushed crystals, gold leaf, epoxy resin, and other materials. In combination with mirrors, they add that wow-effect to my paintings that many people experince.

Mirror paintings are my passion! But I also have many other interests and hobbies, e.g. ballroom dancing, hiking, traveling, writing poems, etc. I practice a healthy and active lifestyle, and feel a strong connection with nature which is my main source of inspiration…

Thank you for visiting my website. Enjoy – and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require more information!
